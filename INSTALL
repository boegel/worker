# Installation requirements

To build the worker application, a C89 complient compiler is required,
as well as the Intel MPI library.

# Runtime requirements

To run the worker commands, Perl 5.10+ is required, as well as the
following non-standard modules:
* `Config::General`
* `Getopt::Long`
* `IO::Scalar`
* `Set::Scalar`
* `Template`

Also, the runtime libraries of th compiler used during installation, and
the Intel MPI library should be available.

Worker is designed to be used with a resource manager or a scheduler.  It
currently supports PBS torque, although it could potentially support others.

# Installing

Obtain the distribution, either by cloning the Github repository, or by
downloading a release.  In the latter case:
```
$ tar xaf <tar_gz>
$ cd worker-<version>
```
Followed by the usual mantra:
```
./configure
make
make install
```
The install path can be changed by `configure`'s `--prefix` option, e.g.,
```
./configure  --prefix=/opt/software/worker-<version>
```

Important: do not forget to tune `<install_path>/conf/worker.conf` to
local requirements.  Items that require attention:
* qsub
* email
* unload_modules
* mpi_module
* mpi_run
* mpi_run_options
